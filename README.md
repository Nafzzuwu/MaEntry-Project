MaEntry is a desktop-based application designed to streamline the attendance tracking and management process for students in a campus environment. With MaEntry, students and lecturers can log in separately, record attendance in real time, and reduce errors or manipulation of attendance data. The application integrates with a PostgreSQL database via Npgsql, ensuring it is efficient, secure, and easy to use.
